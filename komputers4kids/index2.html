          <p> The very foundation of our program comes from generous support from companies and individuals.  In many cases, most companies and individuals dispose of their old equipment after it has reached its lifecycle, this is where komputer4kids can help out.  We provide a way that many corporations can experience not only giving back to their local neighborhoods but receiving a tax incentive at the same time.   So, in this case it is a “win, win” situation for all.  We help you dispose of your aged equipment and you help our kids learn!</p>

          <p> The major project focus for Komputers4Kids is in making it possible for all children who have applied for our "free" komputer program to recieve one.  In making this goal a reality it is necessary to receive generous donations from both personal and corporate donors.  Through our recent campaign we have exceeded our goal of more than 100,000 komputers that have been placed with children in many of our established areas.  As we work to open new areas in outlying areas of major metropolitan cities we have set our new goal of over 250,000 usuable komputers to realize our new dream.</p>

          <p> Our komputer donation program participates in a "zero waste" recycling program.  This means that new and used computer donations are recyeled and provided to the children that are accepted into our program.  All donations of komputer equipment of kash is used to help fund the needs of our programs.  There are no paid employees so all donations are utilized for our programs.</p>
