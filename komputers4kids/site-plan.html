      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Komputer4Kids has been developed to request donations of computers to donate to children who otherwise would not have the opportunity of having one.  We will also develop classes to teach children how to effectively use computers in a fast paced technology world.  Providing computers and training for kids will help them to develop the knowledge and skills necessary in todays learning environment!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our main concentration will be to work closely with medium to large corporations for donations of the computer systems that are no longer needed in their environment.  We will also work with volunteers that will provide training classes both on-line and in person (hands-on) training in neighborhoods and schools.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        The “computer4kids, is a site that brings together computer donations from different sources that will be cleaned and repaired and donated for the specific use of children that would otherwise not have the ability to have their own computer.  These donations will be closely followed up with providing classes for kids to learn the proper care and use of their own system.

      <h3>Donations</h3>
      <p>
        The very foundation of our program comes from generous support from companies and individuals.  In many cases, most companies and individuals dispose of their old equipment after it has reached its lifecycle, this is where komputer4kids can help out.  We provide a way that many corporations can experience not only giving back to their local neighborhoods but receiving a tax incentive at the same time.   So, in this case it is a “win, win” situation for all.  We help you dispose of your aged equipment and you help our kids learn!

      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most rewarding aspects of komputer4kids is working with those who unselfishly give of their time and talents to mak3 a difference in the lives of our kids.   Those that give back do so tirelessly and are rewarded with knowing that they have made a difference.  The komputer4kids “family” is special and become a very important part of all of our lives.
